# OpenAI Function Calling

This repository demonstrates the implementation of **OpenAI Function Calling** capabilities using OpenAI's GPT-4 API. It provides an example of how to enable GPT-4 models to call functions by generating the necessary arguments for them, allowing for automation, data extraction, and various application-specific tasks.

## Overview

OpenAI's function calling feature allows the GPT-4 model to call specific functions and pass relevant arguments dynamically based on natural language inputs. This repository provides a foundational template to integrate function calls into your projects with ease. 

Key benefits of OpenAI Function Calling:
- Automates processes by interpreting human requests and calling corresponding functions.
- Extracts structured data from unstructured text.
- Simplifies interaction between human-readable input and programmatic function execution.

## Features

- **Function Automation**: Automatically call functions based on natural language inputs.
- **Argument Generation**: GPT-4 dynamically generates the required arguments for the function based on the user prompt.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend with new functions and configurations.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- OpenAI API Key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rajurayhan/openai-function-calling.git
    cd openai-function-calling
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Set your OpenAI API key in the environment variable:

    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
    ```

## Usage

To use the function calling setup:

1. Ensure you have configured your OpenAI API key as described above.
2. Run the script to invoke the function-calling model:

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

You can modify the `index.js` file to test out different user prompts and observe how GPT-4 responds by calling the corresponding functions. 


### Example: Simple Function Call

User Input:  
"Add me a task with description 'Task One'"

Function Called:  
`addTask('Task One')`

Model Output:  
`Task added: { id: 3, description: 'Task One', status: 'pending' }`
